I am a cognitive neuroscientist interested in how life experiences — such as sensory deprivation, bilingualism, and sign language — shape the way we represent and organise concepts in the mind. 
My research combines behavioural experiments and neuroimaging approaches to explore the flexibility and resilience of conceptual representation across populations.
