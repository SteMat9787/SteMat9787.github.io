I am a **cognitive neuroscientist** interested in how life **experiences** — such as sensory deprivation, bilingualism, and sign language — shape the way we represent and organise **concepts** in the mind. My research combines behavioural experiments and **neuroimaging** to explore the flexibility and resilience of conceptual representation across populations.
