My research uses bilingualism — and especially **bimodal bilingualism** (signed and spoken languages) — as a model to test how language shapes conceptual organisation.  

- **Conceptual relativity.** I examine whether the structure and modality of a language influence how we perceive and categorise the world, while also probing for amodal, universal aspects of meaning.  
- **L1–L2 interaction.** Behavioural studies (e.g. false cognates) explore whether first and second languages share an integrated semantic system or rely on distinct representations.  
- **Bimodal bilinguals.** Hearing CODAs, fluent in both sign and spoken language, provide a unique opportunity to test how modality (visual–manual vs. auditory–vocal) shapes conceptual knowledge.  
- **Neuroimaging.** fMRI (decoding & RSA) links behavioural patterns with neural representations, clarifying when concepts are modality-specific and when they are shared across languages.  
- **Language learning over time.** Longitudinal studies track how acquiring a new language reshapes semantic space in both behavioural and neural domains.  

Together, these approaches aim to clarify the balance between **language-specific** and **amodal** aspects of conceptual representation.
