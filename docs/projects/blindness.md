### Sensory Deprivation & Sensory Re-acquisition


My work addresses how sensory experience — and its absence — shapes conceptual and semantic representations in the brain.  

- **Auditory categories in the blind.** fMRI studies revealed that the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) encodes sound categories in both blind and sighted individuals, with congenitally blind participants showing an even stronger, “vision-like” categorical organisation ([Mattioni et al., 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/50732)).  
- **Neural reallocation.** Early and late blindness enhance similarity between auditory representations in temporal and occipital cortices, suggesting a partial functional shift from temporal to occipital areas ([Mattioni et al., 2022](https://elifesciences.org/articles/79370)).  
- **Differential vulnerability.** Using advanced multivariate fMRI and DNN modelling, we showed that even brief early visual deprivation leaves permanent traces in early visual cortex, while high-level categorical coding in VOTC remains resilient ([Mattioni et al., 2024, under review](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.30.625697v1)).  

These findings highlight the resilience of high-level semantic systems to altered experience, while revealing sensitive periods for low-level visual encoding. Beyond theory, this work informs **sight restoration research** and provides a rare window into **brain plasticity** through the study of unique populations.
