1. 🧵 Thread: What happens to the visual brain after early transient blindness?
[Our new paper](https://rdcu.be/eQjMH) in Nature Communications explores this through the study of a rare population: people born with dense bilateral cataracts— a transient blindness occurring during a critical window of visual development. 

2. We used fMRI to study how these “cataract-reversal” individuals process visual categories — faces, bodies, houses, tools, and words — and compared their brain responses to those of sighted controls.
The focus: how early deprivation affects both low-level and high-level visual processing, from EVC (early visual cortex) to VOTC (ventral occipito-temporal cortex).
