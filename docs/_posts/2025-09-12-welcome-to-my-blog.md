9-10 Sept 2025 -[Brains United](https://www.kuleuven.be/brain-institute/events-and-outreach/brains-united-neuroscience-meet-up-of-the-lbi-and-the-ions-uc-louvain) is a joint meeting of the KU Leuven Brain Institute and the UCLouvain Institute of Neuroscience


I was happy to present my work on **cataract reversal**  
([Mattioni et al., 2025 · Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65468-7)) 
in a symposium on **Brain Plasticity** chaired by *Hans Op de Beeck* (KU Leuven) and *Olivier Collignon* (UC Louvain).  

The symposium brought together exciting research from both universities, highlighting new perspectives on brain organisation and plasticity.  

It was also a great opportunity to:  
- Learn more about the work happening at **KU Leuven** and **UCLouvain** across cognitive science, neuroscience, and neuropsychology.  
- Connect with colleagues from both institutions in an inspiring and collaborative setting.  

Overall, the meeting reinforced how valuable it is to bridge expertise across labs and disciplines to better understand the human brain.
