On Nov 6th and 7th, I had the pleasure of attending the [“Sign Language Grammars, Parsing Models, & the Brain”](https://sign-language-grammars-parsers-brain.github.io) workshop at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig.
- The workshop was a fantastic opportunity for multidisciplinary exchange among experts approaching sign language from different perspectives — linguistics, neuroscience, computational modeling, and beyond. The discussions were truly inspiring, showing how much can be gained when diverse fields meet around a shared topic.
- I was very happy to have the chance to present my ongoing study on sign language, and I hope this will be the first of many projects in this fascinating area.
- As this was my first experience entering the field of sign language research, I am deeply grateful and touched by how welcoming and open the community is. It was both encouraging and motivating to see such an inclusive and collaborative spirit.
